    Determines where this credential can be used.

    <dl>
        <dt>System</dt>
        <dd>
            This credential is only available to the object on which the credential is associated. Typically you would
            use system-scoped credentials for things like email auth, slave connection, etc, i.e. where the
            Jenkins instance itself is using the credential. Unlike the global scope, this significantly restricts
            where the credential can be used, thereby providing a higher degree of confidentiality to the credential.
        </dd>
        <dt>Global</dt>
        <dd>
            This credential is available to the object on which the credential is associated and all objects that are
            children of that object. Typically you would use global-scoped credentials for things that are needed by
            jobs.
        </dd>
        <!--
            not listing USER scope here because it's hard to imagine the User scoped used anywhere else
            except UserCredentialsProvider, which only uses the USER scope and thus this help page is moot.
        -->
    </dl>

    <p>
    In general, a credential is defined in one place (for example in the credentials configuration page under "Manage Jenkins"),
    then used in another place (for example when connecting to a new SSH slave.)
    The scope allows you to say "this credential is only used by these places" by looking at the relationship
    between the two locations.
